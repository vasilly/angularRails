I am just folowing the tutorial

2nd paragraph. *Italic*, **bold**, and `monospace`. Itemized lists
look like:

  * this one
  * that one
  * the other one

Note that --- not considering the asterisk --- the actual text
content starts at 4-columns in.

> Block quotes are
> written like so.
>
> They can span multiple paragraphs,
> if you like.

in chapters 12--14"). Three dots ... will be converted to an ellipsis.
Unicode is supported. â˜º
